i was born in 9th april,1998. i do not have much memorries of my childhood.. i was not briliant nor very naughty kid ...
i was very introvert and timid person... all in my childhood i remmember how i get bullied by other studtents, how
everyone in my class corner me... how my neighbourhood uncle tried to harras me ... but then there was also some good memories...
when i am with my cousins spending my holidays .... what a golden memories ... so precious to me ... when i am with them i rule over them
they listen to me as i am the older ... we did many good missdeeds together ... i picknicked every sunday ... we played many games together, 
we fight and laugh together ... there was no drama , no big demands , no ups and down... then i decides not to get afraid of new people.
so i decided to make more friends and i will talk to them first ... but have not change anything much ...
